They reached far above me and were surrounding me before I could even hope to notice. It was everywhere, everything, all the once.","\n","^I felt the little hampster running on its wheel in my head give up the more I tried to understand it.","\n","^The only thing I knew for certain, was that something slimy was coiling up my legs.

My throat was full and my legs were starting to twitch and jolt from the encompassing pleasure.","\n","^It held my arms behind my head and tightened its grip just under my breasts.
